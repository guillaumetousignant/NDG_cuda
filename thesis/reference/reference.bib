   abstract = {Aspects of adaptive spectral element methods are presented with emphasis on the a posteriori error estimators used in the automatic mesh refinement process. The nonconforming formulation of the method is reviewed in an effort to illustrate the various mesh refinement options available. Single mesh a posteriori error estimators are developed for the spectral element method. These estimate the actual error incurred by the discretization on a local per element basis and predict the convergence behaviour of the numerical solution as well. As a result the error estimators serve as criteria in the choice of refinement options. The usefulness of the estimators is demonstrated through examples of Navier-Stokes calculations.},

   abstract = {This book offers a systematic and self-contained approach to solvepartial differential
equations numerically using single and multidomain spectralmethods. It contains detailed
algorithms in pseudocode for the applicationof spectral approximations to both one
and two dimensional PDEsof mathematical physics describing potentials,transport, and
wave propagation. David Kopriva, a well-known researcherin the field with extensive
practical experience, shows how only a fewfundamental algorithms form the building
blocks of any spectral code, evenfor problems with complex geometries. The book addresses
computationaland applications scientists, as it emphasizes thepractical derivation
and implementation of spectral methods over abstract mathematics. It is divided into
two parts: First comes a primer on spectralapproximation and the basic algorithms,
including FFT algorithms, Gaussquadrature algorithms, and how to approximate derivatives.
The secondpart shows how to use those algorithms to solve steady and time dependent
PDEs in one and two space dimensions. Exercises and questions at theend of each chapter
encourage the reader to experiment with thealgorithms.},

   abstract = {The one-dimensional decomposition of nonuniform workload arrays with optimal load balancing is investigated. The problem has been studied in the literature as the “chains-on-chains partitioning” problem. Despite the rich literature on exact algorithms, heuristics are still used in parallel computing community with the “hope” of good decompositions and the “myth” of exact algorithms being hard to implement and not runtime efficient. We show that exact algorithms yield significant improvements in load balance over heuristics with negligible overhead. Detailed pseudocodes of the proposed algorithms are provided for reproducibility. We start with a literature review and propose improvements and efficient implementation tips for these algorithms. We also introduce novel algorithms that are asymptotically and runtime efficient. Our experiments on sparse matrix and direct volume rendering datasets verify that balance can be significantly improved by using exact algorithms. The proposed exact algorithms are 100 times faster than a single sparse-matrix vector multiplication for 64-way decompositions on the average. We conclude that exact algorithms with proposed efficient implementations can effectively replace heuristics.},

@article{Patera1984,
   abstract = {A spectral element method that combines the generality of the finite element method with the accuracy of spectral techniques is proposed for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.},
