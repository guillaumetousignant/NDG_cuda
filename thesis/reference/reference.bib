   abstract = {Aspects of adaptive spectral element methods are presented with emphasis on the a posteriori error estimators used in the automatic mesh refinement process. The nonconforming formulation of the method is reviewed in an effort to illustrate the various mesh refinement options available. Single mesh a posteriori error estimators are developed for the spectral element method. These estimate the actual error incurred by the discretization on a local per element basis and predict the convergence behaviour of the numerical solution as well. As a result the error estimators serve as criteria in the choice of refinement options. The usefulness of the estimators is demonstrated through examples of Navier-Stokes calculations.},

equations numerically using single and multidomain spectralmethods. It contains detailed
algorithms in pseudocode for the applicationof spectral approximations to both one
and two dimensional PDEsof mathematical physics describing potentials,transport, and
wave propagation. David Kopriva, a well-known researcherin the field with extensive
practical experience, shows how only a fewfundamental algorithms form the building
blocks of any spectral code, evenfor problems with complex geometries. The book addresses
computationaland applications scientists, as it emphasizes thepractical derivation
and implementation of spectral methods over abstract mathematics. It is divided into
two parts: First comes a primer on spectralapproximation and the basic algorithms,
including FFT algorithms, Gaussquadrature algorithms, and how to approximate derivatives.
The secondpart shows how to use those algorithms to solve steady and time dependent
PDEs in one and two space dimensions. Exercises and questions at theend of each chapter
encourage the reader to experiment with thealgorithms.},

   abstract = {The one-dimensional decomposition of nonuniform workload arrays with optimal load balancing is investigated. The problem has been studied in the literature as the “chains-on-chains partitioning” problem. Despite the rich literature on exact algorithms, heuristics are still used in parallel computing community with the “hope” of good decompositions and the “myth” of exact algorithms being hard to implement and not runtime efficient. We show that exact algorithms yield significant improvements in load balance over heuristics with negligible overhead. Detailed pseudocodes of the proposed algorithms are provided for reproducibility. We start with a literature review and propose improvements and efficient implementation tips for these algorithms. We also introduce novel algorithms that are asymptotically and runtime efficient. Our experiments on sparse matrix and direct volume rendering datasets verify that balance can be significantly improved by using exact algorithms. The proposed exact algorithms are 100 times faster than a single sparse-matrix vector multiplication for 64-way decompositions on the average. We conclude that exact algorithms with proposed efficient implementations can effectively replace heuristics.},

   abstract = {A spectral element method that combines the generality of the finite element method with the accuracy of spectral techniques is proposed for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.},

Using 30 GPU nodes, our simulation can compute a 480x400x80 LBM in 0.31 second/step, a speed which is 4.6 times faster than that of our CPU cluster implementation.

Over the past six years, there has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in general-purpose computing on the GPU, also known as GPU computing, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications.},

Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today's multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5x on average. In this paper, we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels.},

   abstract = {Presents the case for billion-transistor processor architectures that will consist of chip multiprocessors (CMPs): multiple (four to 16) simple, fast processors on one chip. In their proposal, each processor is tightly coupled to a small, fast, level-one cache, and all processors share a larger level-two cache. The processors may collaborate on a parallel job or run independent tasks (as in the SMT proposal). The CMP architecture lends itself to simpler design, faster validation, cleaner functional partitioning, and higher theoretical peak performance. However for this architecture to realize its performance potential, either programmers or compilers will have to make code explicitly parallel. Old ISAs will be incompatible with this architecture (although they could run slowly on one of the small processors).},

We were designing the Piranha system,1 which was a radical point in the CMP design space in that we used very simple cores (similar to the early RISC designs of the late ’80s) to provide a higher level of thread-level parallelism. Our main goal was to achieve the best commercial workload performance for a given silicon budget. Today, in developing Google’s computing infrastructure, our focus is broader than performance alone. The merits of a particular architecture are measured by answering the following question: Are you able to afford the computational capacity you need? The high-computational demands that are inherent in most of Google’s services have led us to develop a deep understanding of the overall cost of computing, and continually to look for hardware/software designs that optimize performance per unit of cost.},
