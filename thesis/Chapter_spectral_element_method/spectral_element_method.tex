\chapter{Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method} \label{chapter:spectral_element_method} 
We will use the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method to solve this problem. This method is
part of the broader spectral methods, with elements from finite-element methods. This method has the
exponential convergence of spectral methods, and the ability to model difficult geometries of
finite-element methods. This method and a way to efficiently translate it to computer code is
described in~\cite{Kopriva2009}. We use this method to solve the 2D wave equation. The main problem
showcased through this work depicts a wave moving diagonally through a square domain.
