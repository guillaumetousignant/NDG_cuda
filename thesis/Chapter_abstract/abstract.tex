In order to simulate complex fluid flows, high-order methods can be used to obtain very fine results. However,

these methods are computationally expensive, and care should be taken to optimise their execution time. 

\textit{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)} are a relatively new architecture in the domain of scientific 

computing, leveraging massive parallelism at the expense of reduced flexibility. To achieve the resolution of

high-order methods with the throughput of GPUs, we use the \textit{discontinuous Galerkin spectral element 

method (DG-SEM)} coupled with parallel \textit{adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)} to solve the two-dimensional 

wave equation. The \textit{discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DG-SEM)} splits the domain in 

elements, within which the solution is represented as a weighted series of orthogonal polynomials, the 

\textit{Legendre polynomials} in this case. To insure no ressources are wasted, the \textit{adaptive mesh 

refinement (AMR)} aims to increase the resolution in regions of interest, via two mechanisms: 

\textit{h-refinement}, where elements are split in multiple smaller ones, and \textit{p-refinement}, where

the polynomial order within an element is increased. In order to retain the fast convergence high-order 

methods are known for, the \textit{mortar element method} is used to resolve the fluxes between geometrically

or order(???) non-conforming elements. Since mesh refinement can increase resolution anywhere in the domain, 

it is possible that some nodes end up with more work to perform than others. Since the nodes need to sync 

multiple times during the calculation, the computation time will be determined by the more heavily loaded

node. To remedy this imbalance, a \textit{space-filling curve (SFC) based} repartitioning algorithm is used

to even out the computational load and to keep a node's elements together and limit the number of interfaces

between nodes, as these transfers are particularly costly when the data also has to be transferred from and 

to the GPUs in addition to between the nodes.
