In order to simulate complex fluid flows, high-order methods can be used to obtain very fine 
results. However,these methods are computationally expensive, and care should be taken to optimise 
their execution time. \textit{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)} are a relatively new architecture 
in the domain of scientific computing, leveraging massive parallelism at the expense of reduced 
flexibility. To achieve the resolution of high-order methods with the throughput of GPUs, we use 
the \textit{discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DG-SEM)} coupled with parallel 
\textit{adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)} to solve the two-dimensional wave equation. 

The \textit{discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DG-SEM)} splits the domain in elements, 
within which the solution is represented as a weighted series of orthogonal polynomials, the 
\textit{Legendre polynomials} in this case. To insure no ressources are wasted, the 
\textit{adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)} aims to increase the resolution in regions of interest, via 
two mechanisms: \textit{h-refinement}, where elements are split in multiple smaller ones, and 
\textit{p-refinement}, where the polynomial order within an element is increased. In order to retain 
the fast convergence high-order methods are known for, the \textit{mortar element method} is used to
resolve the fluxes between geometrically or functionally non-conforming elements.

Since mesh refinement can increase resolution anywhere in the domain, it is possible that some nodes
end up with more work to perform than others. Since the nodes need to synchronise multiple times 
during the calculation, the computation time will be determined by the most heavily loaded node. To 
remedy this imbalance, a \textit{space-filling curve (SFC) based} repartitioning algorithm is used 
to even out the computational load and to keep a node's elements together, limiting the number of 
interfaces between nodes, as these transfers are particularly costly when the data also has to be 
transferred from and to the GPUs in addition to between the nodes.
