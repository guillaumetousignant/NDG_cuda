% Talk about saturation, SEMs

When trying to solve very large problems, a single node with a single \textit{GPU} will have
insufficient processing power and memory to solve the problem in a reasonable time, or at all. To
work with these larger problems, the work needs to be split at another level than \textit{GPU}
parallelism.
