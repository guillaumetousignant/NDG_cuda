The issues that this work aims to overcome are not new, and as such a lot of work has been perform
to overcome them. This section highlights the current state of the domain, and where this work fits
within it.

\section{Spectral Element Methods}\label{section:literature_review:sem}

Large scale spectral element solvers have existed for quite a while now. One such solver is Nek5000,
an open-source Navier Stokes spectral element solver that rune on \acrshortpl{acr:CPU}. It has been
proven to scale well to above a million processors~\cite{Offermans2017}. Other solutions exist, such
as the Nektar++~\cite{Cantwell2015} library. It is a spectral finite element library used to create
purpose-built solvers for different kinds of problems.

These are the kind of
