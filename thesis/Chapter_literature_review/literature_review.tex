The issues that this work aims to overcome are not new, and as such a lot of work has been perform
to overcome them. This section highlights the current state of the domain, and where this work fits
within it.

\section{Spectral Element Methods}\label{section:literature_review:sem}

Large scale spectral element solvers have existed for quite a while now. One such solver is Nek5000,
an open-source Navier Stokes spectral element solver that rune on \acrshortpl{acr:CPU}. It has been
proven to scale well to above a million processors~\cite{Offermans2017}. Other solutions exist, such
as the Nektar++~\cite{Cantwell2015} library. It is a spectral finite element library used to create
purpose-built solvers for different kinds of problems.

These are the kind of solid foundations we wish to build upon in this work. These solvers
traditionally use \acrshortpl{acr:CPU} to compute their solutions. We wish to use
\acrshortpl{acr:GPU}, so the methods will need to be ported to this new architecture.

\section{Graphics Processing Units}\label{section:literature_review:gpu}

In recent years, the scientific computing world has started using \acrshortpl{acr:GPU} to perform
computations. Some traditionally \acrshort{acr:CPU}-based commercial solvers were upgraded to run
entirely on \acrshortpl{acr:GPU}, or have some parts of the code \acrshort{acr:GPU}-accelerated.
Krawezik and Poole present a new \acrshort{acr:GPU}-accelerated direct sparse solver for Ansys
Fluent, boasting a \(2.9 \times \) speedup compared to the \acrshort{acr:CPU}-only solver.
Open-source solutions like OpenFOAM~\cite{Alonazi2015} have also been extended to work on hybrid
\acrshort{acr:CPU} and \acrshort{acr:GPU} architectures. Another example is
RapidCFD~\cite{SimFlow2020}, a collection of OpenFOAM solvers ported to Nvidia \acrshort{acr:CUDA}.

Some brand new solvers have been created for \acrshortpl{acr:GPU}, such as the AmgX solver, a
distributed algebraic multigrid solver. This solver has been shown to have a \(2 \times \) to \(5
\times \) speedup compared to a \acrshort{acr:CPU} implementation~\cite{Naumov2015}.
