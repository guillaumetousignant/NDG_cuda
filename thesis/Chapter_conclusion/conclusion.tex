\section{Future Work}\label{section:conclusion:future_work}
% Block adaptivity, 3D, cooler equations, more cases, have cpu workers, 
% load balancing have weights for N and worker capacity, 
% local time stepping (so the simulation doesn't run exactly as slow as the slowest worker)
% triangles
% Capacity weights especially for split GPUs
% CUDA-aware MPI
% OpenMP, more parallel levels for threads sharing nodes or GPUs
% Limit branching, sorting faces etc in separate arrays
% Coarsening
% Store parent information separately for coarsening
% Different polynomial order in x and y
% Less branching
% Refined when global error is high instead of interval, similar to load imbalance threshold
