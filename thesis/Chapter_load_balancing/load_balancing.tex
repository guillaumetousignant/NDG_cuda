A well made multi-block mesh can distribute the work evenly the different worker processes without
needing runtime adjustment if the topology and areas of more expensive computation stay the same
during the whole computation. This is complicated by the fact that, as seen in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:adaptive_mesh_refinement}, the mesh elements can increase their polynomial
order and split in multiple smaller elements in areas where the solution accuracy is not estimated
to be satisfactory. Unless the regions of interest happen to be evenly distributed between the
different processes, this will lead to an imbalance as some processes are left with more elements,
or higher-order elements, within their domain.

The wall time of the simulation will be driven by the
